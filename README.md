# S-NDR: Solving the S-NDR Equations in 1D

This repository solves the 1D S-NDR equations for electrochemistry. The equations are outlined in [index.ipynb](./index.ipynb). They consist of two diffusion field equations and an equation that only evolves at the boundary of the domain. The equations are solved using [FiPy](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/fipy/)
